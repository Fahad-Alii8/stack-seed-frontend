// createBrowserRouter is a function provided by react-router-dom that defines an array of route objects.  
// Each object corresponds to a specific route and its associated component.  
// It helps manage application routing efficiently without requiring a full page reload.  
// It leverages the browserâ€™s built-in navigation system (window.history.pushState) to enable seamless navigation between pages.
